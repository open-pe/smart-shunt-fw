- fuse voltage sense ground
- add jumper connect IN(-) with ground (using 50ohm resistor or 0?)
	- or capacitor as in ADS1013 dat sheet?
- add 3pin voltage divider/filter pin
- add jumper for ground bypass for HV measurements (common mode >80V)


TODO
- use THT voltage divider resistors (precision)
- isolated I2c bus?
	- or: stackable ina228 (isolated)
- high-speed ADC via spi for ssa-100?
	- 16bit - 20bi
